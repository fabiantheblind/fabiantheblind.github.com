What to say about education? I could have done more but did not have the cash.

## Study of Communication Design B. A.

From October 2004 to July 2012 I've been matriculated at [the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (Germany)](http://www.fh-potsdam.de/) in the field of communication design and have a bachelor of arts degree in this field.

## Advanced Technical College Entrance Qualification

In January 2003 I reached my college entrance qualification by finishing my apprenticeship as salesman in retail.

## Apprenticeship as Salesman in Retail

After working several years for the company No Limits I made a apprenticeship as salesman from in August 2000 to January 2003. I worked at and managed the Titus Store Braunschweig and the No Limits store Magniviertel in that time.

## School Part of the College Entrance Qualification

I reached the school part of my college entrance qualification at the Wilhelm Gymansium in Braunschweig. I must admit that school was a pain for me. I wasn't a good student after all. If this came from me being in puberty and feeling rebellious, having mostly very old and conservative teachers or if the system of "bulimia learning" - I can't tell.

## Before Gymansium

Before we reached Braunschweig my family moved a lot.

- German primary school Madrid
