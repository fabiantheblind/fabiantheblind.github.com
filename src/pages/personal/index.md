## `whoami`

I am the son of Dr. Heidrun Zirfas (✝) and Prof. Dr. Dagoberto Morón León (✝) and I am the youngest of three brothers (one from a different mother). I am a seventies baby, early eighties child and a nineties teenager who was born in Limburg (DE), lived in Kaden (DE), Medellín (CO), Ellihausen (DE), Madrid (ES), Kaden (DE), Schandelah (DE), Braunschweig (DE) and Berlin (DE). Since Berlin is the place where I have lived the longest and it is the place my sons where born I call this my home.
