Currently at the Technologiestiftung Berlin as senior creative technologist working in the CityLAB project with the best team I've ever had the chance to work with. Looking forward to the next years with them. Also big news, I will be teaching digital basics again at the Braunschweig University of Art in the bachelors course visual communication. Totally looking forward to it.

## Administration Professorship at the Hochschule für Bildende Künste Braunschweig (HBK)

We will see how this goes. I'm looking forward to it in winter semester 2023/2024 and summer 2024.

## Lecturer at Kunsthochschule Weissensee for Physical Computing

I did some small workshops in the winter semester 2022/2023 at the [Kunsthochschule Weissensee](https://www.kh-berlin.de/) about Physical Computing to get the students up and running.

## Lecturer at HAWK Hildesheim for Creative coding

At the "Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaft und Kunst Hildesheim/Holzminden/Göttingen" I taught the seminar "Creative Coding" in the summer semester 2022.

## Lecturer at the FH Potsdam for Physical Computing and Creative Coding

In winter 2019/2020 I taught the seminar Creative Technologists - Tracing the City.

## Full Time Creative Technologist @technologiestiftung Berlin

Since January 2019 I'm building prototypes as a senior creative technologist at [Technologiestiftung Berlin](https://www.technologiestiftung-berlin.de/de/startseite/).

## Full Time Creative Technologist @IXDS Berlin

Since September 2017 till December 2018 I have been building physical and digital prototypes as a creative technologist at [IXDS](https://ixds.com/).

## Full Time Lecturer And Lab Supervisor

Since September 2015 was fully employed as artistic research assistant at the FH Potsdam (University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (Germany)). I still do now and then some freelance work but most of my time goes into teaching "Physical Computing" and "Creative Coding". See the <a href="/teaching/">teaching page</a> for an overview of my seminars.

## Part Time Lab Supervisor

From September 2013 till September 2015 I've been part time employed (first 50% then 75%) as lab supervisor at the FH Potsdam (University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (Germany)). There I started to dive deeper into "Physical Computing", server administration, "Creative Coding" and teaching. Starting from the winter semester 2014/2015 I started to teach in the basics module a full 10 credit point seminar and gave several workshops besides that. See the <a href="/teaching/">teaching page</a> for an overview of my seminars.
