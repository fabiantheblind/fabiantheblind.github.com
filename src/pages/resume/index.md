With nearly two decades of experience in creative technology, I've dedicated my career to bridging design and programming through education and open-source development. My career as a professional creative technologist, sparked by Processing and evolving through JavaScript for Adobe applications, JavaScript on the frontend and backend, and Arduino, has led me to create design tools, generative design, teach at universities, and make technology more accessible. Passionate about open-source principles, I've consistently shared my knowledge and creations, aiming to empower others in the intersection of design and code.

As a faculty member at the [Braunschweig University of Art](https://www.hbk-bs.de/), I design the curriculum and introduce students to programming. My courses cover generative design, generative art, and creative coding, with a focus on tools like P5.js, Arduino, and physical computing with microcontrollers. I guide students in applying computational thinking to design and teach them how to publish their work as web pages using CI/CD with Git and GitHub, on platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify.

### Senior Creative Technologist | Technologiestiftung Berlin | January 2019 - July 2024

As a Senior Creative Technologist at [Technologiestiftung Berlin](https://www.technologiestiftung-berlin.de/en/), I played a leading role in the prototyping team for the [CityLAB Berlin](https://citylab-berlin.org/en/start/) project, an innovation lab for the state of Berlin. My responsibilities included full-stack web development, frontend design, and the end-to-end design of web applications, from system architecture to visual appearance. I managed CI/CD pipelines, maintained databases and root servers, and led the technical onboarding of new teammates. I also defined common development practices for code linting, formatting, testing, automated version management, Git flow, and project maintenance on GitHub.

I identified new technologies worth exploring for our mission and established the default technology stack used by the team. Additionally, I delivered various presentations as part of CityLab’s public outreach efforts, particularly in our developer meetups and at re:publica 2022, and conducted internal knowledge transfer initiatives. My work at CityLAB involved contributing to Open Source, Open Data, and Smart City projects.

### Visiting Lecturer | HAWK, FHP, KH Weißensee | 2019 - 2022

As a Visiting Lecturer at University of Applied Sciences and Arts Hildesheim (HAWK), University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (FHP), and Weißensee Academy of Art Berlin (KH Weißensee), I delivered a series of lectures and workshops focused on creative coding, generative design, generative art, and physical computing. My teaching content was aligned with the courses I teach at the University of Art Braunschweig, covering topics such as P5.js, Arduino, microcontroller usage, C++, and the application of computational thinking in design. I guided students in exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, equipping them with the skills to apply programming and digital tools in their artistic practices.

### Senior Creative Technologist | IXDS | August 2017 - December 2018

At [IXDS](https://web.archive.org/web/20180601094208/https://www.ixds.com/), I was responsible for developing prototypes using Framer, with a focus on creating interactive, user-centric designs. One of my key projects involved creating an OpenFrameworks C++ application that utilized NDI streams from Adobe After Effects to control LED strips attached to a Teensy microcontroller. This project also included PCB and hardware design. I worked with high-profile clients such as BMW and BSH, delivering prototypes that met their specific needs.

### Artistic-Scientific Assistant, Lab Supervisor | University of Applied Sciences Potsdam | Juli 2013 - Juli 2017

During my time as an Artistic-Scientific Assistant at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, I honed my skills as a lecturer and deepened my knowledge of web development. I was actively involved in sysadmin work and began using P5.js, which I later integrated into my teaching of physical computing and generative design and art. My role also included maintaining and teaching the use of a laser cutter, where I guided students in preparing data using Illustrator and Blender. I conducted numerous workshops and seminars on these topics, which solidified my expertise in creative coding and physical computing.

As a Lab Supervisor during my first year in 2013, I was responsible for building up the [interface lab](https://www.fh-potsdam.de/en/study-further-education/labs-workshops/interface-workshop), including organizing its structure and developing its formats. I led a team of students to develop software for organizing and maintaining the lab’s equipment, ensuring smooth operation and availability of resources. Additionally, I maintained several touch tables over the years used within the lab, contributing to the lab’s interactive capabilities and supporting various projects.

### Freelance Design, Motion Graphics, Programming, Heat Transfer Printing | Misc clients | 2006 - 2015

While studying communication design at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (FHP), I began applying my skills in the fashion industry as a heat transfer printer, which eventually expanded into print production and motion graphics. Over time, I transitioned into programming, where I developed custom script plugins and automation tools for Adobe After Effects and Adobe InDesign, enhancing efficiency in both print and motion design projects.

### Apprenticeship as a Retail Salesman | No Limits, Titus | 2000 - 2003

I completed an apprenticeship in fashion retail, where I developed foundational skills in sales, customer service, and inventory management.
